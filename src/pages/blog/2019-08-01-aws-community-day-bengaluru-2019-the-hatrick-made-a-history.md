AWS Community Day Bengaluru 2019 - The Hatrick made a history to be the biggest AWS Community Day in Asia. The event was spanned across two days with full day Workshop & Conference and also proudly takes the credit of first ever AWS Community Day across the globe to host Diversity Program. It certainly gives immense pleasure to pen down the rich experience much more than being part of the team behind!

## **Day 1**

Deep Learning & Serverless Workshops were in partnership with AWS User Group Bengaluru and CodeOps Technologies with the expert trainers from Amazon Internet Services Private Limited (AISPL) Certification & Training Team. Usually the conference / workshop ticket sales would be at peak in the last two weeks but Serverless workshop as an exception was sold out two weeks before.

## Day 2

It was 5:00am on the conference day, the majestic spectacle of sunrise have not yet penetrated into Hotel Conrad but the organizers / volunteers have already gathered for the finally planning & get ready to execute on the much awaited D-Day. That's the spirit and beauty of the community which inspires, energizes, renews and gives lots of new hope on how all hands put together would make wonders! The arrival of Mumbai, Chennai user group leads and Konfhub team in next hour or so gave a feel of friends & family gathered for a typical Indian wedding preparation.
