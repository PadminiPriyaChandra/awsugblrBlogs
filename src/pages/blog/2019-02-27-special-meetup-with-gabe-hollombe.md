**Build your own multi-tenant photo album web app with React & GraphQL using AWS Amplify & AppSync**

> In this demo, we build a data-driven web app that lets users upload to shared, secure photo galleries. We use AWS AppSync to get up and running quickly with a GraphQL API that backs our data in Amazon DynamoDB. In addition, we demonstrate how to use AWS Amplify library to authenticate users, communicate with our API, and manage photo uploads. Finally, we add in AI-powered face and object tagging using Amazon Rekognition, allowing users to discover photos without any manual data entry.
