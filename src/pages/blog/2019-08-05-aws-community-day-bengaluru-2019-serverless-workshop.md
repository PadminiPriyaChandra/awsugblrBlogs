Day -1 of AWS Community Day Bengaluru 2019 is for the focused learners to gain deeper appreciation of the select AWS Technology - _Deep Learning on AWS & Serverless on AWS._\
__\
The one-day Serverless WorkShop on AWS get you up to develop AWSome App - a Serverless Food-delivery Application conducted by experts from AWS.

In this workshop developers will deploy a simple web application that enables users to request food from the AWSome Food website using services like AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Step Functions and Amazon Cognito.

With the knowledge from the workshop, developers can build and deploy their own serverless applications using these services for common use cases like web applications, analytics, and more.

We had 45 registrations and 43 have turned up. The highlight was the tickets got sold out 2 weeks before the workshop and were really sad to turn down to many interested folks. Radisson Blu is always a go to place for such workshops with yummy food, stable internet connection and spacious lab kind of setup apt for workshops.

The application presented users with an HTML & JS based user interface for ordering food items and indicating the location where they would like the food to be delivered. The interface on the backend with a RESTful web service will submit the request and find and dispatch food to the requesterâ€™s location. The application also provided facilities for users to register with the service and log in before ordering food.

The application architecture was designed to use S3 hosts static web resources including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files which are loaded in the user's browser. JavaScript executed in the browser sends and receives data from a backend API built using Lambda & Step Functions and API Gateway. Amazon Cognito provides user management and authentication functions to secure the backend API. Finally, DynamoDB provides a persistence layer where data can be stored by the API's Lambda function.\
