_This is a series of blog posts chronicling my _[_experience at AWS re:Invent 2018_](https://www.awsugblr.in/tags/awsreinvent-2018/)_. Hope you enjoy the posts._

One good reason from Amazon to continue to run as  the reign and undisputed champ in both Internet retailing and Cloud Computing may be because they customer obsessed hence not competitor obsessed, understands very well that focusing on the customer makes a company more resilient.

EBC Meetings (Executive Briefing Center) was designed for customers in Re:Invent 2018 with the details including topic, schedule, location, company person attending, and AWS account member participating. These were closed group discussions with wide variety of topics (including but not limited to) like Containers (EKS - ECS - Fargate - DevOps), DMS, Athena, Serverless, SageMaker, Amazon Lex, Amazon ElasticSearch 

Great sessions and am glad that I could make it for some of them as part of Infor.
