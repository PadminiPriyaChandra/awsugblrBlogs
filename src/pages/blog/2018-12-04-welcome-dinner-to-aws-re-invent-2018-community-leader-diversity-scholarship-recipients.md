The AWS team have hosted Welcome Dinner to AWS re:Invent UG Leader diversity scholarship recipients at [AquaKnox](https://www.venetian.com/restaurants/aquaknox.html) Restaurant on Sunday - November 24.

This restaurant is in what is called “restaurant row” in the Venetian/Palazzo (that corridor of restaurants is very close to the entrance to the Venetian/Sands convention center).
