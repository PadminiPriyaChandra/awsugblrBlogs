CloudWarriors is a closed group invite only programme which aims is to bring together a group of recognized experts and trailblazing power users of AWS Cloud to share their experiences, learn from others and gain exclusive access to AWS resources. It is also a forum for most skilled customers to get more out of their AWS Cloud and become strong technology advocates.

Its phenomenal that there have been 300% growth in running container instances over 15 months across startups, SMBs and Enterprises with 10 million+ tasks per week is being launched on AWS.

And the driving factors are of course to lower down failure rates and faster response to the customers.

Gabe walked us through the ML stack that have broadest and deepest set of capabilities.

Good to see how C-SPAN uses Amazon Rekognition to automatically index video news from footage. Yes, you can put AI to work for your business without any second thought.
