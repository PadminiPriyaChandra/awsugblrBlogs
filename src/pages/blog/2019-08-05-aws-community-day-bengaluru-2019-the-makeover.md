When I sat down to write about AWS Community Day Bengaluru 2019 experience, it flashed "Why only about what happed on AWS Community Day?" and "Why not what was the effort made over 5 Months to put up this mega event?"  \
For me, in a nutshell, its more of learning to the hearts content and gained all the experience needed to venture into a start-up IT Company ðŸ˜Š.\
\
The ideation of 3rd AWS Community Day Bengaluru sparkled around mid Jan 2019, while the organizers of AWS User Group Bengaluru ([Jeevan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeevandongre/), [Sathyajith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sathyabhat/), [Runcy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/runcyoommen/), [Prashanth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hnprashanth/) & myself, [Bhuvaneswari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhuvanas/)) wanted to do it bigger and better. [Jeevan Dongre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeevandongre/), the Lead AWS User Group Bengaluru & AWS Community Hero as usual have raised the bar high to have 800+ attendees (close to double compared to [AWS Community Day Bengaluru 2018](http://installjournal.blogspot.com/2018/09/aws-community-day-bengaluru-2018-day.html)). The intend was to look for venue within the city limits. After couple of weeks' exploration and analysis, finalised Hotel Conrad for 27th July 2019 and the started backtracking the timeline with the end goal and big picture in mind. First thing was to look beyond a day's event and that's how workshop was introduced in association with [Konfhub Technologies](https://konfhub.com/).

If I have the power to hire for a large enterprise, I would hire all of these highly skilled, self-motivated, committed, passionate organizers / volunteers, who are matured enough to respect & appreciate each others talent. Apparently they are are diversified by their skillsets and multitude of talents but united by common goal with the prime focus to get AWS Community Day Bengaluru 2019 into flying colours.

Getting featured in [yourstory](https://yourstory.com/2019/07/aws-group-bengaluru-host-community-day) was a booster for the effort that has gone in and the grandeur that was expected!\
\
5 Months have thus passed like a lightening and proud to be part of these great minds!
