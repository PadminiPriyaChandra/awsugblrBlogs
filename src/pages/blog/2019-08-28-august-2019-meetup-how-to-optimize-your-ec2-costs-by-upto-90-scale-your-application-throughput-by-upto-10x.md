After a very successful [AWS Community Day 2019](https://www.awsugblr.in/blog/2019-08-01-aws-community-day-bengaluru-2019-the-hatrick-made-a-history/), we are pretty excited to bring back our monthly meetups with a super good session. The event will be held on 31st August 2019 at Locus in 80 ft road, Koramangala.

We have [Chakravarthy Nagarajan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chakravarthy-nagarajan-7653311a/) (popularly known as Chakra), the Spot Specialist SA from AWS talking about Amazon EC2 Spot Instances. You will learn to optimize your EC2 costs by upto 90%, scale your application throughput by upto 10x and build a resilient service.

Amazon EC2 Spot instances are compute instances provided from the spare pooled capacity of On-Demand EC2 infrastructure, offered with low, predictable prices - discounted upto 90% on the On-Demand instance prices - with a caveat of these instances being "interruptible" after a 2 min notification, if Amazon needs to pull back the Spot instances capacity to serve On-Demand customers.

In this session delivered by Spot Specialist teams from Amazon, learn how customers are using EC2 Spot instances - not just as an attractive low cost purchase model for Cloud computing resources - but as an architectural approach to run applications with highly scalable compute resources, while working with instance interruptions to improve the resilience of their application services.

 Here you go with the agenda

* Conceptual Overview Presentation for EC2 Spot instances - 1 hr
* Hands on Demo of Spot Fleet and ASG - (15 mins)
* Workload specific Spot integrations - (Auto-Scaling, EMR and Containers)  - (30 mins)
* Pop Quiz, prizes announcement and Wrap up (15 mins)
