Mark you calendar for **17th Sep 2019 6:30pm to 8:30pm**!

[AWS User Group Bengaluru](https://www.awsugblr.in) & [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) are super thrilled in joining hands to host Sep 2019 meetup with our expert speaker [Arun Gupta](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/evangelists/arun-gupta/), Principal Technologist, Amazon Web Services. Come join us to enrich your knowledge with **Machine Learning on Kubernetes using Kubeflow.**

### Agenda:

Kubernetes provides isolation, auto-scaling, load balancing, flexibility, and GPU support. These features are critical to run computationally, data-intensive and hard to parallelize machine learning models. Declarative syntax of Kubernetes deployment descriptors makes it easy for non-operationally focused engineers to easily train machine learning models on Kubernetes.

This talk will explain why and how Kubernetes is well suited for single and multi-node distributed training, deploying your machine learning models in production and setting up visualization tools like TensorBoard for monitoring. Specifically it will show how to set up a variety of open-source machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow on a Kubernetes cluster. The attendees will learn distributed training, massaging and inference phases of setting up a Machine Learning framework on Kubernetes. Attendees will leave with a GitHub repo of fully working samples.

### About the speaker:
