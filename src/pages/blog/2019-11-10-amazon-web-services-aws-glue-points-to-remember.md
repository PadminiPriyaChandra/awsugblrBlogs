1. Glue is a fully-managed, pay-as-you-go, extract, transform & load (ETL) service that automates the time-consuming steps of data preparation for analytics.

2. It also allows users to setup, orchestrate & monitor complex data flows.

3. Users should use Glue to discover properties of the data their own, transform it & prepare it for analytics. 

4. Glue automatically generates Scala or Python code for users ETL jobs that they can further customize using tools they are already familiar with. 

5. The metadata stored in the Glue Data Catalog can be readily accessed from Athena, EMR & Redshift Spectrum.

6. The AWS Glue Data Catalog is a central repository to store structural and operational metadata for all data assets.

7. Users can import custom Python libraries and Jar files into AWS Glue ETL job.

8. Glue provides a robust set of orchestration features that allow users to manage dependencies between multiple jobs to build end-to-end ETL workflows.

9. Glue ETL jobs can either be triggered on a schedule or on a job completion event.

10. Glue manages dependencies between two or more jobs or dependencies on external events using triggers.

11. Glue consists of a Data Catalog which is a central metadata repository, an ETL engine that can automatically generate Scala or Python code, and a flexible scheduler that handles dependency resolution, job monitoring & retries.

12. Glue can automatically discover both structured and semi-structured data stored in data lake on S3, data warehouse in Redshift & various databases running on AWS.

13. The AWS Glue Data Catalog is Apache Hive Metastore compatible and is a drop-in replacement for the Apache Hive Metastore for Big Data applications running on Amazon EMR.

14. Glue crawlers scan various data stores users own to automatically infer schemas and partition structure and populate the Glue Data Catalog with corresponding table definitions and statistics.

15. Glue monitors job event metrics and errors & pushes all notifications to CloudWatch.

16. Glue ETL is batch oriented & users can schedule their ETL jobs at a minimum of 5 min intervals.

17. Glue's FindMatches ML Transform makes it easy to find and link records that refer to the same entity but donâ€™t share a reliable identifier.

18. Glue works on top of the Apache Spark environment to provide a scale-out execution environment for data transformation jobs.

19. Glue SLA guarantees a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least 99.9% for AWS Glue.

20. Glue takes a data first approach and allows users to focus on the data properties and data manipulation to transform the data to a form where they can derive business insights.

21. Users can use AWS Glue to build a data warehouse to organize, cleanse, validate & format data.

22. Glue supports data encryption at rest for Authoring Jobs in AWS Glue and Developing Scripts Using Development Endpoints.

23. AWS provides Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption for data in motion. Users can configure encryption settings for crawlers, ETL jobs & development endpoints using security configurations in AWS Glue.

24. A development endpoint is an environment that users can use to develop and test their AWS Glue scripts.

25. AWS Glue tags Amazon EC2 instances with a name that is prefixed with aws-glue-dev-endpoint.
