Early in the morning, at dawn (rather before the dawn), AWS Summit started to witness the attendees getting queued up for registration and not wanting to make them wait, registration counter was opened an hour earlier to welcome the attendees with the Welcome Kit. The first 2000 registrants got special SWAG - a laptop bag AWS logo! 

## Registration
