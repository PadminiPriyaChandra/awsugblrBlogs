The first 2000 registrants got special SWAG - a laptop bag AWS logo!

## Closing Note

For a day long power packed conference, the first and last impression would last long in the busy minds of attendees.\
The day concluded with the closing note by none other than Madhusudan Shekar, Head Digital Innovation, AISPL. \
\
Madhu spoke about resiliency and how to build a team structure to build for resiliency (some components of the chaos talk I gave in the community day) and then about building a culture for innovation and experimentation\
\
Who else could give an everlasting & impactful impression as Madhu ?
