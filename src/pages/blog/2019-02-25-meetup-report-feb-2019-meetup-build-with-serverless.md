The February 2019 meetup was held at [Ethnus](https://ethnus.com/), Bangalore.\
\
Build with Serverless started with  a warm welcome by [Jeevan Dongre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeevandongre/), AWS Community Hero and Lead - AWS User Group Bengaluru and introduced our speaker of the day, [Prashanth HN](https://in.linkedin.com/in/hnprashanth) co-founder of Wheelsbox.com.

## Talk started with the question: “What is Serverless Architecture ?”

A serverless architecture is a way to build and run applications and services without having to manage infrastructure. By using a serverless architecture, developers can focus on their core product instead of worrying about managing and operating servers or runtimes, either in the cloud or on-premises. Serverless has some benefits, for instance:

* Flexible Scaling
* Automated High Availability
* No Server/Infrastructure Management
* Pay for Value

AWS provides a set of fully managed services that one can use to build and run serverless applications. Serverless applications don’t require provisioning, maintaining and administering servers for backend components such as compute, databases, storage, stream processing, message queueing and more.
