The January 2019 meetup was held at the newly opened Amazon Internet Services Private Ltd office.

AWS re:Invent 2018 recap started with a warm welcome by [Jeevan Dongre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeevandongre/), AWS Community Hero and Lead - AWS User Group Bengaluru and introduced our speaker of the day, [Madhusudan Sekhar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhusudanshekar/), Principal Technical Evangelist and Head Digital Innovation, Amazon Internet Services Private Limited.

Madhu took us on quick ride around **_how did AWS enthusiasts re:Invent in Las Vegas_ **right from _Harley ride_ to _re:Play party_ and from _deep-dive sessions_, _expert sessions_, _hackathons_ to _hands-on labs_. 

Probably this would have kindled an eagerness in the attendees to look forward for re:Invent 2019 early bird registration?

[Bhuvaneswari Subramani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhuvanas/) shared her experience as an [AWS diversity scholarship recipient at  re:Invent 2018](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/meet-the-women-building-aws-technical-communities-around-the-world/) and you may read more about stories in the blog - [Journey through re:Invent 2018 ](https://www.awsugblr.in/blog/2018-12-03-journey-through-re-invent-2018/).
