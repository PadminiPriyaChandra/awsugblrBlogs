Madhu took us on quick ride around \`how did AWS enthusiasts re:Invent in Las Vegas\` right from Harley ride to re:Play party and from deep-dive sessions, expert sessions, hackathons to hands-on labs. 

Probably this would have kindled an eagerness in the attendees to look forward for re:Invent 2019 early bird registration?

Bhuvaneswari Subramani shared her experience as an AWS diversity scholarship recipient at  re:Invent 2018 and you may read more about stories in the blog - Journey through re:Invent 2018 

Madhu took over the stage back to help us dive deep into all new announcements for AWS Services and of course the next 3 hours was lively to witness the tale from the technocrat!
