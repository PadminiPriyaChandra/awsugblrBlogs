DVC201 Making AWS User Communities More Inclusive





At technical community gatherings, Meetups, or events, the majority of attendees and speakers tend to be men. Women often feel uncomfortable attending such events, leading women in technology to start technical communities for only for women. Although the purpose of these women-in-tech communities is to help more women feel welcomed and create equality between men and women in the industry, these communities might be inadvertently doing the exact opposite. In this talk, we share perspectives on gender diversity in technology, and we discuss the value of participating in mixed-gender Meetups. We also share insights from AWS user communities worldwide, and we discuss steps we take to make our AWS community in Israel—one of the largest in the world, with over 6,000 members—more inclusive.



This session is part of re:Invent Developer Community Day, a series led by AWS enthusiasts who share first-hand, technical insights on trending topics.DVC201 Making AWS User Communities More Inclusive
