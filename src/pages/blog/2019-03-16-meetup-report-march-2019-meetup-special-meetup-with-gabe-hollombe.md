LogMeIn, Bengaluru was geared up to host AWS User Group Bengaluru's Special Meetup with\
Gabe Hollombe. It was unbelievable that by 6:15pm the hall was full. LogMeIn Team acted quickly to setup overflow session in another conference hall with #gotomeeting, their trademark e-meeting solution.

The most awaited session started with a warm welcome by [Jeevan Dongre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeevandongre/), AWS Community Hero and Lead - AWS User Group Bengaluru and introduced our speaker of the day, [Gabe Hollombe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabehollombe/), Technical Evangelist at Amazon Web Services, Singapore.







Thanks to [Rashmi Shreedharan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rashmis/) for all the arrangements.

In end, a thank you note by Jeevan and announcements for our upcoming Community Day - 2019 ( https://communityday.awsugblr.in/ ).
