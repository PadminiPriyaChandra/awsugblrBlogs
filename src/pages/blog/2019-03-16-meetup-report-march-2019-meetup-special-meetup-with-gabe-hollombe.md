LogMeIn, Bengaluru was geared up to host AWS User Group Bengaluru's Special Meetup with\
Gabe Hollombe. It was unbelievable that by 6:15pm the hall was full. LogMeIn Team acted quickly to setup an overflow session in another conference hall with #gotomeeting, their trademark e-meeting solution.

The most awaited session started with a warm welcome by [Jeevan Dongre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeevandongre/), AWS Community Hero and Lead - AWS User Group Bengaluru and introduced our speaker of the day, [Gabe Hollombe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabehollombe/), Technical Evangelist at Amazon Web Services, Singapore.

Gabe discussed on building a photo sharing album (web app) using tools/frameworks like #React, #GraphQL, #APIGateway. AWS services like Amplify, Appsync, Cloudformation were also used.

The session was at a brisk pace with live coding using AWS Cloud9 workspace and Gabe articulated & orchestrated that very well with an in depth coverage starting from setup, installation, env configuration and development.

Over & above the renowned technical & training skills, Gabe stunned us with his passion for photography too by photos collection with variety of birds / sparrows as part of the Rekognition Demo.

On the whole, it was a Highly interactive session from start to end.

Here you go with the High level architecture for reference
