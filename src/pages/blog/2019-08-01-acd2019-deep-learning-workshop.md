The one-day Deep Learning WorkShop on AWS was designed with an intend to teach cloud-based deep learning (DL) solutions on the AWS platform to the developers who are responsible for developing deep learning applications or the developers who want to understand concepts behind deep learning and how to implement a deep learning solution on AWS.

The course taught how to run your models on the cloud using Amazon EC2‒based deep learning Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and Apache MXNet on AWS frameworks. In addition, trainers explained how to use Amazon SageMaker and deploy your deep learning models using AWS services like AWS Lambda and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)—all while designing intelligent systems on AWS.

Thanks to the expert technical trainers Hemanth Gahankari & Shinduri KS from AISPL.

In attendees got to learn the following and tested their new skills and were all set to apply knowledge to their working environment through a variety of practical exercises.

* Define machine learning (ML) and deep learning
* Identify the concepts in a deep learning ecosystem
* Leverage Amazon SageMaker and MXNet programming frameworks for deep learning workloads
* Fit AWS solutions for deep learning deployments

Felicitation to the trainers
