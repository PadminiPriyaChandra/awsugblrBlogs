Owing to the success of AWS User Group Bengaluru's Feb 2019 meetup on [Build with Serverless](https://www.awsugblr.in/blog/2019-02-27-meetup-report-february-2019-meetup-build-with-serverless/) by [Prashanth HN](https://in.linkedin.com/in/hnprashanth) co-founder of [Wheelsbox.com](https://wheelsbox.com/) and overwhelming appreciations in social media, we had a request from [Marcelo Palladino,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mfpalladino/) co-organizer [AWS user group Sao Paulo](https://www.meetup.com/awsusergroupsp/) to schedule an online presentation to the Sao Paulo user group members. 

That casual conversation in twitter didn't end there!

Prashanth & Marcelo continued to brainstorm to give the initial notion, a shape!

It wasn't easy due to timezone difference: Sao Paulo meetup usually happens at 7:00 PM on a weekday and it sounded unrealistic for Prashanth, a typical Bengalurian who would obviously be in deep sleep at 3:00 AM. 

So Marcelo ran a surgery to understand if people would be interested in the talk and attending this meetup at a different time.

100% of the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGXTHSMA4TI98zyPRugo0Io06jWfOVXXSk2wzPJarY8bdLFA/viewform) turned out to be **Yes** and we are all set to make a new record!\
\
To make it convenient for both time zones, we decided to do it at 10:00 AM BRT / 6.30 PM IST and marked the calendar for 27th April 2019.\
\
Knowledge sharing is amplified to cross the geographical boundaries through e-meetup. Way to go, @prashanth and @awsugblr !

Thanks to Marcelo for the effort to plan for this e-meetup and all the very best for Prashanth.
