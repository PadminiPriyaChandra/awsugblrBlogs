The first ever **Hackathon** organized by **AWS Community Leaders, AWS **&** Intuit** in Kochi, India for the IT professionals and college students, the budding engineers, turned to be a huge success. And the event stands as a testimony for what a grand victory could be when all hands put together. With that self-contentment, would like to bring our involved experience to the table for you to visualize it through our eyes.

Theme set for the Hackathon is as follows and more details can be found on our previous [blog](https://www.awsugblr.in/blog/2019-01-04-hackathon-for-good-kochi-india/)

**Hackathon for Good**

> This is a hackathon to inspire you to develop solutions that will bring lasting change. There are a lot of seemingly insurmountable problems in society today.
>
> For example: 
>
> bad roads, air and noise pollution, corruption in government, income disparity, outdated methods of education, unequal access to resources, reduced opportunities for women, etc.
>
> It is not easy for an individual or organization to fully solve any of these problems on their own. But each of us can make a small contribution to the complete solution. Is there a problem you are passionate about tackling with technology? Then this hackathon is a place where you can find like minded engineers and programmers to team up with and create new solutions.

## Hackers on the Job

With no further delay, Hackers were on the job once their Team ID / Team Names were allocated.

Thanks to [Runcy Oommen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/runcyoommen/) for setting up a git repository for the contestants to commit their source code. He had provided detailed instructions to use the repository and helped the teams to setup.

The teams working on AWS Cloud had additional advantage of availing $20 AWS Credit coupons. Thanks you AWS Team!

To break the monotony and have some fun, Runcy have organized **AWSome Quiz **during the break time**.**

## Presentation

The main session of the day was to show case their creativity & implementation coupled with their deep sense for social cause to address the most impactful issues. \
And that was the tough moment for the judges to identify & isolate the most influential \`problem statement and solution\`.
