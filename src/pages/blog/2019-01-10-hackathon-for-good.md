The first ever **Hackathon** organized by **AWS Community Leaders, AWS **&** Intuit** in Kochi, India for the IT professionals and college students, the budding engineers, turned to be a huge success. And the event stands as a testimony for what a grand victory could be when all hands put together. With that self-contentment, would like to bring our involved experience to the table for you to visualize it through our eyes.

**Hackathon for Good**

> This is a hackathon to inspire you to develop solutions that will bring lasting change. There are a lot of seemingly insurmountable problems in society today.
>
> For example: 
>
> bad roads, air and noise pollution, corruption in government, income disparity, outdated methods of education, unequal access to resources, reduced opportunities for women, etc.
>
> It is not easy for an individual or organization to fully solve any of these problems on their own. But each of us can make a small contribution to the complete solution. Is there a problem you are passionate about tackling with technology? Then this hackathon is a place where you can find like minded engineers and programmers to team up with and create new solutions.
