Prashanth HN, co-organizer AWS User Group Bengaluru was very much excited over June 8th & 9th weekend at AngelHack Hackathon Bengaluru for AWS Amplify.

As am Amplify expert, it was certainly a great momement for Prashanth to mentor the hackers at the AngelHack Hackathon, who were striving to make an impactful code with amplify and of-course had the previlige to talk about Amplify on behalf of AWS.
