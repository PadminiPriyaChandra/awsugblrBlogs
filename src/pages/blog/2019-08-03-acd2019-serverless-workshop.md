The one-day Serverless WorkShop on AWS 



We had 45 registrations and 43 have turned up. The highlight was the tickets got sold out 2 weeks before the workshop and were really sad to turn down to many interested folks. Radisson Blu is always a go to place for such workshops with yummy food, stable internet connection and spacious lab kind of setup apt for workshops.

Thanks to the expert technical trainers Madhusudhan Shekari, Head of  from Amazon Internet Services Private Limited (AISPL) and Srushith R .

KonfHub played a key role in arranging the logistics and which helped making the training happen smoothly and successfully. Heartfelt thanks to [Ganesh Samarthyam](https://twitter.com/GSamarthyam) & [Hari Kiran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gharikiran/)!
