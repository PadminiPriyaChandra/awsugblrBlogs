The much awaited e-meetup for AWS UG Sao Paulo friends to [Build with Serverless](https://www.awsugblr.in/blog/2019-03-24-april-2019-e-meetup-awsuglr-in-collaboration-with-aws-user-group-sao-paulo-to-help-build-with-serverless/) started with great enthusiasm. 

[Marcelo Palladino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mfpalladino/), co-organizer AWS user group Sao Paulo introduced the speaker to the Sao Paulo user group members and Prashanth went through his live demo covering #amplify use case as detailed [here](https://www.awsugblr.in/blog/2019-02-27-meetup-report-february-2019-meetup-build-with-serverless/).

>
> The Meetup worked perfectly. We had a good sound system and a big screen. All experience was as a regular Meetup.
>
> Prashanth did a great introduction of AWS Amplify and showed how to build an entire application from scratch using amplify.
>
> Speaking as an organizer, everything worked like a charm. We had a lot of questions after the presentation and stayed for 40 minutes talking about the content. We feel like a mission accomplished and we hope do it again and continue to "build bridges" and to cause some social impact.

Let's continue to nurture the cross-learnings across the boundaries.\
