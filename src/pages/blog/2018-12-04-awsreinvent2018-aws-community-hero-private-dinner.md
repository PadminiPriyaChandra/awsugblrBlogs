AWS Heros annual private dinner is usually hosted on Monday evening of re:Invent week. This year, it was on November 26, 7PM-10PM, at the Foundation Room (which is on the top floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel) and around 40 guests aka heros were expected.  Thanks to [Ross Barrich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rossbarich/) for inviting us ([Bhuvaneswari Subramani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhuvanas/), [Ana Luca Diegues](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anluca/), [Zamira Jaupaj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zamirajaupaj/) & [Jocylyn Sy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jocylynsy/)), the re:Invent UG Leader Diversity Scholarship recipients as Special Guest.

To make our life easier to reach the venue, we were provided one-way coach shuttle transfers from the Venetian main entrance to the Foundation Room. Two large black mini coaches with an “AWG Ambassador” chauffer company logo in red on the side was convenient to locate as it sounded similar to AWS.

Ross have made arrangements for monitor set up at the dinner venue to watch re:Invent Monday Night Live. Well, how many watched is a mystery though :)
