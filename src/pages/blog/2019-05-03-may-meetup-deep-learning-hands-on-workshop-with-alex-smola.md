Save the date! We're super excited to host our May 2019 meetup with a star speaker [Alex Smola - Director of Machine Learning](https://alex.smola.org/) at AWS 

### Agenda:

Computer vision is one of the key applications of deep learning. Object recognition, detection, segmentation, and pose estimation are by now staples of modeling with deep networks. In this tutorials Alex will give a brief introduction to MXNet Gluon. 

This is followed by an in-depth discussion of modern convolutional networks, including ResNet, ResNext and SENet. We will cover models for detection such as YOLO and SSD. This is followed by image segmentation (e.g. via MaskRCNN) and semantic segmentation. 

We conclude by reviewing the problem of pose estimation and a review of content available at D2L.ai, a novel open source textbook on deep learning, based on Jupyter notebooks, that is fully executable by its readers.

### 

* Unit 1 - Introduction to MXNet Gluon (tensors, Autograd, devices, basic training)
* Unit 2 - Modern convolutional neural networks (ResNet, ResNext, SENet)
* Unit 3 - Object detection (YOLO / SSD)
* Unit 4 - Image Segmentation (Mask RCNN)
* Unit 5 - Pose Estimation
  Unit 6 - Dive into Deep Learning (D2L.ai)

## Pre Requisites

* Please bring your laptops along for the hands-on. WiFi access would be provided at the venue.
* The participant needs to do some simple installation on their laptops and there is no need for AWS account. Programs will run locally - http://d2l.ai/chapter_install/install.html
