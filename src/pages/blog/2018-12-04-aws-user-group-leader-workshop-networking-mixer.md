This is a series of blog posts chronicling my [experience at AWS re:Invent 2018](https://www.awsugblr.in/tags/awsreinvent-2018/). Hope you enjoy the posts.

The AWS User Group Leader Workshop & Networking Mixer was a private party hosted by [Ross Barich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rossbarich/)  during re:Invent week for all the AWS User Group leaders attending re:Invent.

This event was from  4PM-8PM Wednesday, November 28 at the Rockhouse restaurant (within the Venetian Canal Shoppes) and the agenda was as follows:

ยง  4-6PM: Intros, UG Leader lightning talks, and small group discussions on community building

ยง  6PM-8PM: Networking mixer with food and drinks

Thanks to Ross for the well organized discussion platform for AWS User group leads across the globe.
