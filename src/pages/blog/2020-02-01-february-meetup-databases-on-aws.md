**Talk I Title:** Introducing Dgraph and tips and tricks for running your own distributed database on EKS

**Abstract:** Dgraph is an open-source, transactional, distributed, native Graph database. Dgraph is optimized for high-performance reads and writes. It can serve queries and mutations with low latency and high throughput, even when they involve deep joins and traversals. We all know about Kubernetes, the favourite container orchestration platform for most developers.

Running stateless services on K8's is by far the most popular use case for K8's, and there's a mixed opinion for using it for deploying and managing your databases.

**About Speaker:** [Karthic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hackintoshrao/) works as a Developer Advocate at Dgraph Labs during the day and is a musician by evening. With over five years of contributions to developing infrastructure tools in Open source Go, he has the unique distinction of contributing to a web server in Go (Caddyserver), a distributed object storage in Go (Minio.io) and now a distributed database written in Go.

**Talk II Title:** Running Multi-tenanted Databases on AWS RDS - Technical & Operational Considerations

**About Speaker:** [Vijaya Sagar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vijayasagar/) is Head of Cloud Engineering at Amagi. He has over 20 years of experience in software engineering, with prior stints at Gracenote, Althea, Wipro, InSilica and SiRF.
