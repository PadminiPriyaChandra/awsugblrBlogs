Thanks to Gabe to paint lovely picture on the inquisitve minds with AI Services, ML Services and ML framework & Infrstructure.

Went to explaining about object & scene detection, face recognition, optical character recognition. It was a great learning experience to witness how Policy Bazar in India have used AI for their Business development.

Lunch conversations with women from different experience levels was a great feeling but all were united by common goal of learning to be on Cloud 9.
