_This is a series of blog posts chronicling my _[_experience at AWS re:Invent 2018_](https://www.awsugblr.in/tags/awsreinvent-2018/)_. Hope you enjoy the posts._

Becoming AWS Certified helps individuals gain credibility for their AWS expertise and enables organizations to identify skilled professionals to lead IT initiatives. \
AWS Certification Lounge & Reception at Re:Invent 2018 was a good recognition for the AWS Certification achievements, where we had access the following benefits at re:Invent:

* Complimentary AWS Certified gift
* Access to AWS Certification Lounges all week both at Aria and Venetian
* Access to AWS Certification Appreciation Reception
