AWSUGBLR is volunteer driven, group of passionate Amazon Web Services (aka [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)) {Developers, Architects, Users, Evangelists} who meet to {share best practices, discuss up coming features, pit falls, etc} in Bengaluru. AWSUGBLR meets regularly and until now, the meetups were not documented. This blog aims to capture our learning and share them.

Community-based learning is the best way to enhance the concepts being taught by connecting with enthusiasts in person, thereby sharing first-hand experiences and familiar, accessible examples.

All skills levels are welcome to help accomplish our motto of learning, sharing and networking. Letâ€™s join hands to empower this tech community to make it bigger and better!
